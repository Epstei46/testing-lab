Manual Tests for the functionality of the website cloned from https://github.com/DevMountain-QA/wanted-queries.git

High level (broad) tests:
- Enter Wanted page should allow the user to enter a new warrant.
- Modify Wanted page should allow the user to modify an existing warrant.

Low level (specific) tests:
- Navigation bar on Home page, should be able to navigate to Enter Wanted page.
- On Enter Wanted page, if text was entered into different fields, Clear button should clear all fields.

Smoke/Sanity Test (basic functionality):
- Does the website load home page and rest of the pages properly in different browsers? So like, is the site functioning properly?
